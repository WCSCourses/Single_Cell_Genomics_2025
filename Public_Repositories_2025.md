## Exploring public scRNA-seq repositories

In this section, we cover key public databases for single-cell data and other databases for gene expression, containing information for humans and other organisms. To enhance learning, we provide hands-on exercises for accessing, exploring, and analyzing these databases, allowing users to develop essential skills in biological data manipulation.
